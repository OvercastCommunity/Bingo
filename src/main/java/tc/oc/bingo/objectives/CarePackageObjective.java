  // When player get a 5 kill streak (configable)

  // Give them an item that allows them to summon a care package

  // Maybe once player places it on ground it will take 10 seconds to drop (check they can build?
  // before giving them?)

  // Care package will drop from the sky (falling chest with chickens on leads attached like a
  // parachute)

  // When chest lands the person who called it in can open and get some set loot

  // Maybe remove after `x` time of not being opened?
  // Only allow opener to use it? locked for just them for `x` seconds?
  // Remove chest once looted?

  // Reward player once they take out the loot (or open the chest)
